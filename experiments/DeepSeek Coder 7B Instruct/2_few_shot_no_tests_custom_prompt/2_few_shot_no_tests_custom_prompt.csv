","Sure, here is a Python function that removes all digits from a list of strings:

```python
def remove(lst):

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input list. For each string, it uses the `filter` function to remove all characters that are digits. The `isdigit` method is used to check if a character is a digit. If it is, the `filter` function removes it. The `join` method is then used to combine the remaining characters into a single string.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
strings = ['abc123', 'def456', 'ghi789']
print(remove(strings))  # Output: ['abc',","def remove(lst):
    return [''.join(filter(lambda x: not x.isdigit(), string)) for string in lst]","assert remove(['4words', '3letters', '4digits']) == ['words', 'letters', 'digits']

Write a python function to find whether the given number is present in the infinite sequence or not. The function should have the following name: does_Contain_B.

### Response:
","In Python, you can't directly check if a number is in an infinite sequence. However, you can create a function that checks if a number is in a finite sequence. Here's an example:

```python
def does_Contain_B(sequence, num):

```

This function takes a finite sequence and a number as input, and returns True if the number is in the sequence, and False otherwise.

If you want to check if a number is in an infinite sequence, you would need to have some way of generating or accessing that sequence. For example, if you have a function that generates the sequence, you could use that to check if the number is in the sequence. Here's an example:

```python
def generate_infinite_sequence(start):
    i = start

","Sure, here is a Python function that checks if the sum of divisors of two numbers are equivalent:

```python

        return sum

    return sum_of_divisors(num1) == sum_of_divisors(num2)
```

This function works by first defining a helper function `sum_of_divisors` that calculates the sum of all divisors of a given number. It then returns True if the sum of the divisors of `num1` is equal to the sum of the divisors of `num2`, and False otherwise.

Write a function to delete the smallest element from the given heap and then insert a new item. The function should have the following name: heap_replace.

### Response:
","Here is a Python solution using the `heapq` module, which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.

```python

In this function, `heapq.heapreplace(heap, item)` replaces the smallest element in the heap (the one at the root of the heap) with the new item. The function returns the old root value. If the heap is empty, it raises an `IndexError`.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

### Instruction:
Write a python function to find the minimum operations required to make two numbers equal. The function should have the following name: min_Operations.

### Response:
","Here is a Python function that calculates the minimum operations required to make two numbers equal. The function assumes that the operations are addition or subtraction.

```python
def min_Operations(num1, num2):

    elif num1 > num2:
        return num1 - num2

```

This function works by subtracting the smaller number from the larger one. The result is the minimum number of operations required to make the two numbers equal.

Please note that this function assumes that the numbers are non-negative. If you want to handle negative numbers as well, you would need to modify the function to handle that case.

Please note that this function returns the intersection in the form of a list, not a set. If you want the result to be a set, you can simply change `list` to `set` in the return statement.

### Instruction:
Write a function to choose specified number of colours from three different colours and generate all the combinations with repetitions. The function should have the following name: combinations_colors.

### Response:
","Here is a Python solution using the `itertools` module:

```python
import itertools

def combinations_colors(colors, num):
    return list(itertools.product(colors, repeat=num))
```

In this function, `colors` is a list of three different colours and `num` is the number of colours to choose. The function returns a list of all possible combinations of `num` colours, with repetitions allowed.

Here is an example usage:

```python
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
num = 2
print(combinations_colors(colors, num))
```

This will output:

```python
[('red', 'red'), ('red', 'green'), ('red', 'blue'), ('green', 'red'), ('green', 'green'), ('green', 'blue'), ('blue', '","import itertools

Write a function to get a colon of a tuple. The function should have the following name: colon_tuplex.

","Sure, here is a simple function in Python that takes a tuple and returns the element at the specified index.

```python
def colon_tuplex(tuplex, index):

In this function, `tuplex` is the tuple you want to access and `index` is the position of the element you want to return.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
# Define a tuple
my_tuplex = (""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"", ""e"")

# Get the third element
print(colon_tuplex(my_tuplex, 2))  # Output: ""c""
```

Please note that Python uses zero-based indexing, so the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.

### Instruction:
Write a function to reflect the modified run-length encoding from a list. The function should have the following name: modified_encode.

```python
def modified_encode(lst):

This function uses the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module to group the elements of the list by their values. It then returns a list of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is the length of the group (i.e., the number of times the element appears in the list), and the second element is the value of the group.

### Instruction:
Write a python function to count the number of rectangles in a circle of radius r. The function should have the following name: count_Rectangles.

### Response:
","The number of rectangles that can be inscribed in a circle of radius r can be calculated using the formula:

π * r^2

This formula is derived from the fact that the area of a rectangle is equal to the area of two circles. So, if we have a rectangle inscribed in a circle, we can consider it as two circles of radius r. The area of the rectangle is equal to the area of two circles, which is 2 * π * r^2. Therefore, the number of rectangles is equal to the area of the rectangle divided by the area of one rectangle.

Here is the Python function:

```python
import math

def count_Rectangles(r):
    return math.pi * r ** 2
```

This function takes the radius of the circle as input and returns the number of rectangles that can be inscribed in the circle.

### Instruction:
Write a function to remove tuple elements that occur more than once and replace the duplicates with some custom value. The function should have the following name: remove_replica.

### Response:
","Here is a Python function that removes duplicate tuples and replaces them with a custom value:

```python
def remove_replica(tuples, custom_value):
    seen = set()

            seen.add(t)
            result.append(t)
        else:
            result.append(custom_value)
    return result
```

This function works by iterating over the input list of tuples. For each tuple, it checks if it has been seen before. If it has, it appends the custom value to the result list. If it hasn't, it adds the tuple to the seen set and appends it to the result list.

### Instruction:
Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple. The function should have the following name: count_Occurrence.

### Response:
","Here is a Python function that counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple:

```python
def count_Occurrence(tup, list):
    count_dict = {}
    for ele in list:
        count_dict[ele] = tup.count(ele)
    return count_dict
```

This function takes a tuple and a list as input. It initializes an empty dictionary `count_dict`. Then it iterates over each element in the list. For each element, it counts the number of occurrences in the tuple using the `count()` method and stores the count in `count_dict` with the element as the key. Finally, it returns the `count_dict`.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
tup = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a', 'b', '","def count_Occurrence(tup, list):
    count_dict = {}
    for ele in list:

### Instruction:
Write a python function to find the sublist having minimum length. The function should have the following name: Find_Min.

### Response:
","Here is a Python function that finds the sublist with the minimum length:

```python
def Find_Min(lst):
    min_len = len(lst[0])
    min_sublist = lst[0]

    for sublist in lst:
        if len(sublist) < min_len:
            min_len = len(sublist)
            min_sublist = sublist

    return min_sublist
```

This function works by initializing the minimum length to the length of the first sublist and the minimum sublist to the first sublist. It then iterates over each sublist in the list, updating the minimum length and minimum sublist if a shorter sublist is found. Finally, it returns the sublist with the minimum length.

### Instruction:
Write a function to find the smallest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm. The function should have the following name: heap_queue_smallest.

### Response:
","Here is a Python solution using the heapq module, which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.

```python
import heapq

def heap_queue_smallest(numbers):

```

This function works by first converting the input list into a heap, then using the `nsmallest` function from the heapq module to find the smallest element in the heap. The `nsmallest` function returns a list of the n smallest elements from the input list, so we return the first (and only) element of this list.

Please note that this function will return a list of the smallest element, not a single integer. If you want the function to return a single integer, you can modify it like this:

```python
import heapq

    heapq.heapify(numbers)
