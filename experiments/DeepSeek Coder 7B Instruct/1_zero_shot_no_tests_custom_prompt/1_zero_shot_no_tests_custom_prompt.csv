This function takes a list of tuples and an integer `k` as input. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the tuples from the original list that have a length not equal to `k`. The function then returns this new list.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:

```python

This function works by using the built-in `zip` function to pair up the corresponding elements from the two tuples. It then uses a generator expression to calculate the exponentiation of each pair, and stores the results in a new tuple.

This function works by iterating over increasing powers of 2 until it finds one that is greater than the given number. It then returns the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the given number.

This function works by converting the list to a set, which removes any duplicate elements. If all elements in the list are the same, the length of the set will be 1. If there are different elements, the length of the set will be greater than 1. The function then returns True if the length of the set is less than or equal to 1, and False otherwise.

This function works by iterating over the string `s` and only including characters at odd indices in the new string. The `%` operator is used to determine the remainder of the division of the index by 2. If the remainder is not 0, the index is odd, and the corresponding character is included in the new string.

Then, it converts the result to binary and counts the number of 1's in the resulting binary string. This is the Hamming distance.

For example, if you call `hamming_Distance(1, 7)`, it will return `3` because `1` (binary `01`) and `7` (binary `111`) have 3 bits in common (the second and third from the right).

If any item in the subset is not found in the superset, the function immediately returns False. If the function has iterated over all items in the subset without returning, it means all items in the subset are in the superset, so it returns True.

"Write a python function to find the minimum operations required to make two numbers equal. The function should have the following name: min_Operations.

This function works by simply subtracting the smaller number from the larger one and taking the absolute value of the result. This gives the minimum number of operations required to make the two numbers equal.

For example, if you call `min_Operations(5, 10)`, it will return `5` because you would need to subtract 5 from 10 five times to make them equal.

This function works by defining a regular expression pattern that matches any word (`\b\w`) that is between 3 and 5 characters long (`{3,5}`). The `\b` at the start and end of the pattern ensures that we only match whole words, not parts of words.

You can use this function like this:

","Here is a Python function that counts the unset bits in a given number:

```python
def count_unset_bits(n):

This function works by converting the number to binary using the built-in `bin` function, and then counting the number of '0's in the binary representation. The `-1` is used to exclude the leading '0' in the binary representation.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:

```python

```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is already in the dictionary `freq_dict`, it increments the count by 1. If the character is not in the dictionary, it adds it with a count of 1. Finally, it returns the dictionary.

You can use this function like this:

"Write a python function to sort a list according to the second element in sublist. The function should have the following name: Sort.
","Sure, here is a Python function that sorts a list of lists according to the second element in each sublist:

The `key` parameter of the `sorted` function is a function that takes an element from the iterable and returns a value that will be used for sorting. In this case, the `key` function is `lambda x: x[1]`, which returns the second element of each sublist.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:

"Write a function to find all possible combinations of the elements of a given list. The function should have the following name: combinations_list.

This function works by generating all possible combinations of the elements of the input list `lst`. The `itertools.chain` function is used to flatten the list of combinations, and `itertools.combinations` is used to generate the combinations. The range of `i` goes from 0 to `len(lst) + 1`, which includes all possible lengths of combinations.

Here is an example usage:

```python

"Write a function to remove specific words from a given list. The function should have the following name: remove_words.
","Here is a Python function that removes specific words from a given list:

```python
def remove_words(word_list, words_to_remove):
    return [word for word in word_list if word not in words_to_remove]

This function uses list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the words from `word_list` that are not in `words_to_remove`.

Here's an example of how you might use this function:

```python
word_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
words_to_remove = ['apple', 'date']

new_list = remove_words(word_list, words_to_remove)

print(new_list)  # Output: ['banana', 'cherry', 'elderberry']

"Write a function to check if the common elements between two given lists are in the same order or not. The function should have the following name: same_order.

```python
def same_order(list1, list2):
    common_elements = [value for value in list1 if value in list2]
    return common_elements == list2
```

This function works by first creating a list of common elements between the two input lists. It then checks if this list of common elements is the same as the second input list. If they are the same, it means that the common elements are in the same order in both lists, so the function returns True. If not, it returns False.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [2, 3, 4]
print(same_order(list1, list2))  # Output: True
```

"Write a python function to find the average of odd numbers till a given odd number. The function should have the following name: average_Odd.
","Here is a Python function that calculates the average of odd numbers till a given odd number:

```python
def average_Odd(n):
    sum_of_odd = 0

            count += 1
    return sum_of_odd / count

# Test the function
print(average_Odd(11))  # Output: 5.0
```

This function works by iterating over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For each number in the range, it checks if the number is odd by checking if the remainder of the division by 2 is not equal to 0 (`i % 2 != 0`). If the number is odd, it adds it to `sum_of","def average_Odd(n):
